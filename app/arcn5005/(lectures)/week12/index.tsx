      "React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. \n\
    It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies. \n\
    React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. \n\
    Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality.",

    notes:
      "JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file. \n\
    Although there are other ways to write components, most React developers prefer the conciseness of JSX, and most codebases use it. \n\
    But as the Web became more interactive, logic increasingly determined content. \n\
    JavaScript was in charge of the HTML! This is why in React, rendering logic and markup live together in the same place—components.",

    notes:
      "Another notable feature is the use of a virtual Document Object Model, or Virtual DOM. \n\
    React creates an in-memory data-structure cache, computes the resulting differences, and then updates the browser's displayed DOM efficiently.[26] This process is called reconciliation. \n\
    This allows the programmer to write code as if the entire page is rendered on each change, while React only renders the components that actually change. \n\
    This selective rendering provides a major performance boost",
